Most problems with running OpenTK-based Applications are related to the target platform missing the proper drivers.

OpenTK requires these components installed:

* Either Mono or .Net \(not both\).
* An OpenGL driver for your graphics card.
* The OpenAL driver for your Operating System.

Below are links for your convenience. Note: Many of those sites require Javascript enabled to function.
