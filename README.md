Welcome and thanks for using the Open Toolkit library!

This manual will guide you through the necessary steps to develop a project with OpenTK. You will learn how to setup a new project, how to successfully use the tools provided by OpenTK and, finally, how to distribute your project to your end-users. You will also find information on writing performing code and maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

This manual is written in a way that allows skipping from section to section as needed, so feel free to do that; or you can read it sequentially from start to end, if you prefer. Keep in mind that you may add a comment at any point - we always try to improve the manual and high-quality feedback will help not only you but future OpenTK users, too. You can also browse the[OpenTK API reference](https://web.archive.org/web/20150923092918/http://www.opentk.com/files/doc/annotated.html); additionally, the[forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20150923092918/http://www.opentk.com/forum)contains a lot of example code for various problems.

It is our hope that the time invested reading this book will be paid back in full. So let's get started!
